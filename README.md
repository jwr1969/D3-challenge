# D3 Homework - Data Journalism and D3
    
Using D3 (D3 is a javascript library) techniques, I created a scatter plot that represents each state with circle elements. Pulling in the data from `data.csv` by using the `d3.csv` function I created 4 plots (i.e. two values per axis – smokers % and obesity as y-axes and median age and income for x-axes) that can be selected and then transition slowly before you eyes. Each axis is rescaled automatically. Tooltips have also been added to show exact values when the user hovers their cursor over a particular data point.
